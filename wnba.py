### üèÄ Who is Caitlin Clark?
Caitlin Clark is an American professional basketball player, and she is one of the greatest collegiate athletes in history who created a phenomenon now known as the ‚ÄúCaitlin Clark effect‚Äù due to her dynamic playmaking, deep shooting range, and record-breaking performances that drew unprecedented attention to women's basketball. She was born on January 22, 2002. Clark joined NCAA Division I in 2020 at the University of Iowa and later became the all-time leading scorer and a two-time National Player of the Year. Caitlin Clark's impact on NCAA women's basketball was remarkable, marked by unprecedented levels of viewership and fan engagement. The championship game between Iowa and LSU drew 9.9 million viewers, which was the most-watched women's college basketball game on record. Furthermore, in 2024, because of her presence, several games featuring Iowa drew millions of viewers, as they had become a must-watch attraction. After graduation, Clark joined the WNBA in 2024, which also triggered a historic surge in viewership and fan engagement. The average viewership of regular-season WNBA games on ESPN jumped from 440,000 in 2023 to 1,400,000 in 2024, marking a staggering 218% year-over-year increase. This leap far surpassed the steady but modest growth seen in previous years, where viewership ranged from 171,000 to 440,000 between 2017 and 2023.
